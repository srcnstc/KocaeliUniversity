# Video Stabilization

# version 1.0.0
Video stabilization refers to algorithms used to improve video quality by removing unwanted camera shakes and jitters due to hand jiggling and unintentional camera panning. The optimal path is calculated using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method. Stabilization is achieved by applying a movement in the opposite direction of the movement.
